# Data Visualization of Boston Crimes to Detect Firearms Use
This presentation was made as part of the Artificial Intelligence Certification Program in 2022. The test was completed in three hours.

## Introduction:

In this presentation, I used data visualization to analyze Boston crimes dataset and detect the use of firearms. The goal of this project is to give new insights to the Mayor's team about the criminal activities in Boston and help them prevent them.

## Data:

The data used for this project is the Boston Crimes dataset from 2015. The dataset contains information about the type of crime, the date, the time, the location, and the use of firearms.

## Methods:

The data was analyzed using Python and the Matplotlib library. The following visualizations were created:

A map of Boston showing the distribution of crimes by type.
A bar chart showing the number of crimes by type.
A bar chart showing the number of crimes over time.
A pie chart showing timeframe of crimes involving firearms.

## Results:

The results of the analysis showed that the most common type of crime in Boston, where a firearm is used, is Violence and Harassment, followed by Fraud and Violations. 

## Conclusion:

The results of this project can help the Mayor's team to better understand the criminal activities in Boston and develop strategies to prevent them. The use of firearms is a serious problem in Boston, and the Mayor's team should focus on preventing these situations.

## Recommendations:

The following recommendations are made based on the results of this project:

- The Mayor's team should focus on preventing firearm-related crimes.
- Law enforcement officers should prioritize these zones when on patrol, as this will create a sense of police presence and prevent crime.
- If the zone is difficult to access, officers can coordinate to have backup and work in teams.
- Violence and harassment interventions are the types of interventions where firearms have been used. Therefore, it would be wise for field officers to get backup in those types of interventions.
- Data showed an hourly trend, showing that the most dangerous time is Saturday at midnight.
- A violent event can take place at any time, but we have provided the main trends. Officers should always be prepared for a case where self-defense is needed.



Thank you for your time.
